## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in seconds using the Windows Package Manager (winget):

```powershell
winget install DimitarRadenkov.SnippingTool
```

*Prefer a manual install? Download the latest `SnippingTool-Setup-*.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/dimitar-radenkov/SnippingTool/releases) page.*

1. Install SnippingTool with `winget install DimitarRadenkov.SnippingTool` or download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/dimitar-radenkov/SnippingTool/releases).
2. Press `Print Screen` to open the capture overlay and select the region you want.
3. Annotate, copy, save, pin, or record the region from the overlay and recording HUD.

## ✨ Why use this over the built-in Windows tool?

- **Live Video Annotations:** Draw, highlight, and redact *while* recording. No need for post-production video editing.
- **Privacy First (Live Blur):** Drag over sensitive content (passwords, emails, API keys) to apply a live Gaussian blur that stays hidden in the final export.
- **Built-in OCR:** Lasso any text on your screen (even in images or videos) to instantly copy it to your clipboard.
- **Pin to Screen:** Pin captured screenshots as floating, always-on-top windows for quick reference while coding or writing.

## Latest features

- **Show your point while recording** — Draw on the captured region as you record, then switch between interactive and drawing modes from the HUD.
- **Stay in control without breaking flow** — Pause, resume, stop, switch tools, clear annotations, and open the output folder from one floating HUD.
- **Redact sensitive content live** — Blur annotations now sample from the live recording region, so private details stay hidden in the final video.

## Why people use it

- **Show the problem, not just describe it** — Bugs and UI issues are easier to understand when the screenshot or recording already contains the important highlights.
- **Make tutorials easier to follow** — Arrows, text, and numbered steps keep people focused on what matters.
- **Hide private details before sharing** — Blur emails, passwords, tokens, and anything else you do not want on screen.
- **Work from one place** — Capture, annotate, copy, save, pin, and record without bouncing between tools.

## Features

- **Region capture** — Press the configured hotkey (default: `Print Screen`) to draw a selection on screen
- **Frozen screen snapshot** — The screen is captured instantly when the hotkey is pressed, freezing menus, tooltips, and popups exactly as they appear
- **Selection magnifier** — A zoomed loupe follows your cursor while drawing the capture region for pixel-accurate selection
- **Configurable capture hotkey** — Change the capture hotkey to any key you prefer from Settings
- **Annotation tools** — Arrow, line, rectangle, circle, pen, highlighter, text, numbered steps, blur
- **Blur tool** — Drag over sensitive content (faces, emails, passwords) to apply a Gaussian blur before sharing
- **OCR — Copy Text** — Draw a lasso around text in the screenshot to extract it via OCR and copy to clipboard (uses Windows.Media.Ocr, no external dependencies)
- **Open existing image** — Load a PNG, JPG/JPEG, or BMP from the tray menu and annotate it without taking a new screenshot
- **Pin screenshot** — Pin the captured screenshot as a floating, always-on-top, resizable window for quick reference while you work
- **Undo / redo** — Full undo/redo stack during annotation
- **Copy & auto-save** — Copy to clipboard; optional auto-save to a configurable folder
- **Screen recording** — Record a selected region to MP4 (H.264 via ffmpeg)
- **Recording-time annotations** — Add shapes and text directly on top of a recording while it is in progress
- **Capture delay** — Configurable countdown (0 / 3 / 5 / 10 s) before the selection overlay appears, useful for capturing menus and hover states
- **Auto-updates** — A background service checks GitHub Releases on every launch and on a configurable schedule (every day / 2 days / 3 days). When a new version is found a tray balloon appears; click it to confirm, watch the progress bar, and the installer runs automatically — no browser, no manual downloads
- **System tray** — Runs silently in the background; all actions accessible from the tray icon
- **Theme support** — Choose Light, Dark, or follow the system theme from Settings

## Use cases

- **Bug reports** — Capture a precise region, annotate it, and copy or save the result for issue tracking and support requests
- **Documentation** — Create quick step-by-step screenshots with arrows, numbered steps, and text callouts for guides and tutorials
- **Live workflow capture** — Record a selected region while drawing annotations on top of the recording as you work
- **Sensitive content redaction** — Blur passwords, emails, and other private details before sharing screenshots or recordings
- **Text extraction** — Select text in a screenshot with OCR and copy it directly to the clipboard

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- [.NET 10 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

## Installation

**Via winget (recommended)**

```powershell
winget install DimitarRadenkov.SnippingTool
```

**Manual installer**

Download the latest `SnippingTool-Setup-*.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/dimitar-radenkov/SnippingTool/releases) page and run it. During setup you can choose to download `ffmpeg.exe`, which is required for MP4 recording and GIF export.

## Troubleshooting

- **Recording or GIF export does not start** — SnippingTool requires `ffmpeg.exe` for MP4 recording and GIF export. If you skipped the ffmpeg download during setup, install `ffmpeg.exe` next to the app, under `Assets\ffmpeg`, or on `PATH`.
- **OCR is unavailable** — OCR uses Windows.Media.Ocr and requires a supported Windows build.
- **Hotkey seems ignored** — Make sure another app is not already using the same key and try changing the capture hotkey in Settings.
- **App is running but not visible** — SnippingTool lives in the system tray after launch.

## Building from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dimitar-radenkov/SnippingTool.git
cd SnippingTool

dotnet build SnippingTool/SnippingTool.csproj
dotnet run   --project SnippingTool/SnippingTool.csproj
```

## Running tests

```powershell
dotnet test SnippingTool.Tests/SnippingTool.Tests.csproj
```

## Settings

Open **Settings** from the tray icon to configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Screenshot save folder | Where auto-saved screenshots are written |
| Auto-save on copy | Automatically save every screenshot when copied |
| Capture delay | Countdown (sec) before the selection overlay opens |
| Capture hotkey | The key that triggers the capture overlay (default: Print Screen) |
| Recording output folder | Where recorded videos are saved |
| HUD close delay | How long the recording HUD stays visible after stopping (0 / 3 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 s) |
| Default annotation colour | Pre-selected colour when the overlay opens |
| Stroke thickness | Default pen/shape width |
| Auto-update check interval | How often to check for new releases: Every day / Every 2 days / Every 3 days / Never |
| Theme | App appearance: Light, Dark, or System (follows Windows) |

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

## Versioning

Versions are managed automatically by [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning).

- The base version (`major.minor`) is declared in [`version.json`](version.json).
- The patch number is derived from the **commit height** — it increments automatically with every commit, so you never need to touch it manually.
- On a tagged release (`v*`) the version has no pre-release suffix (e.g. `1.2.5`). On non-release builds a short commit hash is appended (e.g. `1.2.5-g1a2b3c4`).

To bump the version:

| Goal | Action |
|---|---|
| Bug-fix / patch | Nothing — commit height auto-increments |
| New feature (minor) | Edit `version.json` → `"version": "1.3"` |
| Breaking change (major) | Edit `version.json` → `"version": "2.0"` |

## Tech stack

- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** — `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection** — constructor injection throughout
- **Serilog** — file + debug logging (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SnippingTool\logs\`)
- **ffmpeg** — external encoder used for MP4 recording and GIF export
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting** — Generic Host + `BackgroundService` for the auto-update background loop
- **Windows.Media.Ocr** — built-in Windows OCR for text extraction
- **Hardcodet.Wpf.TaskbarNotification** — system tray icon
- **Nerdbank.GitVersioning** — automatic semantic versioning from git history
- **xUnit** — unit tests
